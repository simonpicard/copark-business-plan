# Copark's business plan

It is very frequent for drivers in dense area to struggle to park their car. Indeed, there is often too many cars for the number of spots available. Many drivers say that finding a spot is a loss of time and a frustrating moment. What is even more frustrating is to see streets without available spot but with plenty of empty spots. Although counter-intuitive, this scenario is very frequent. Indeed, all the parking spots in front of personal garage, or driveways, are not in use for most of the time. _Copark_ will take advantage of this observation by allowing driveway owners to put their personal spot at the disposition of other users.
